### What I learned

Used this challenge to learn about css variables, rems/ems, and dvh/dvw to create responsive web pages. The :focus-visible psuedo class allows the user to use tab to navigate through the page. I've also learned how to load and use custom fonts with this [resource](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-load-and-use-custom-fonts-with-css#loading-a-self-hosted-font-with-font-face).
